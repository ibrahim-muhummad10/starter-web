Syntax highlighting is automatic and is selected in one of two methods. It can be chosen via the menu with View, Highlight Mode or via the lower statusbar. The statusbar, enabled via the View menu, displays programming language options for many types of sources, scripts, markup and scientific formats. A screenshot of the statusbar in use is located further down this page.
